    Iframe review
    - page in page, HTML inside another html

    - How do you handle iframe
     we need to switch to <iframe> to be able to do any action on any web element inside of it.
     - How many ways do you know to switch:
      3 ways:
      1. index
        driver.switchTo().frame(0)
      2. id, name
        driver.switchTo().frame("id");
        driver.switchTo().frame("name");
      3. web element
        WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.locator);
        driver.switchTo().frame(iframeLocator);

TestBase: parent of all tests in our framework, by extending our test cases we can easily handle before and after methods
    Actions review
        it is used for "advanced " mouse and keyboard actions
        How to use Actions
        1. Create an object of Actions class
    * POM: review

    What is POM design?
        we create Java classes for our each page of the project
        we are storing useful WebElements(reusable), methods
    How do we implement POM design
        constructor: have to pass PageFactory class form selenium
        gets 2 param: driver obj. this (pointing obj of the specific class)
    provides us with useful methods
    Advantages:
        - re-usability
        - easy to maintain
        - easy to explain to non-technical people
        - it handles staleElementExceptions, it checks for freshness of the elemnets

***** Between POM pages you can create inheritance relationship
If you have a page which is the default (means you see it whenever you navigate) page, parent of other POM pages

*** Homework for later:
        create POM pages for allProducts and Order page

*** In class task
        go to
        Login: credentials: Tester, test
        Navigate to Orders link, then navigate back to allOrders link
        click on one checkbox for "Charles Dodgeson"
        then click deleteButton
        then logout from the page

                 New topic: Explicitly wait
Q: How do you handle synchronization in selenium:\
What is synchronization?
    Moving, working, operating at the same time
    in movies

    In WEb Automation: Java is fast, webpage is slower, we need to handle this synch. problem.Other wise code will break.

    1. static wait: Thread.sleep from Java, also we used it in BrowserUtils.sleep method
        -   I put 2 sec for my test, my friend clones the project, but 2 sec. not enough for him. Environmental problem. may be the internet is slower at his house

    2. Dynamic Waits:

        * Implicit Wait( applies to all elements of the project, you need to define 1 time and it is enough)

        * Explicit Wait
            can be used to wait under certain conditions
           for example: vyTrack we have loader screen, need to wait loader screen.
             - wait until element is visible
             - wait until element is clickable
             Doesn't depend on wait time of Implicit wait
             Only applies 1 time in that line that is used
